# Discovering Latent Patterns in Academic Collaboration Network based on Community Detection Approach

# Syllabus
Network Science has a broad demand in various academic fields and industries. This workshop is a primary introduction to Social Network Analysis using Python and NetworkX, a powerful and mature python library for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. This graph library is suitable for operation on large real world graphs: e.g., graphs in excess of 10 million nodes and 100 million edges. Due to its dependence on a pure Python "dictionary of dictionary" data structure, NetworkX is a reasonably efficient, very scalable, highly portable framework for network and social network analysis. Based on professionals experience in the network science field, the combination of mentioned tools could be effectively beneficial. It is crucial for contributors in this workshop to have a fundamental knowledge of Python and Network Science methods
